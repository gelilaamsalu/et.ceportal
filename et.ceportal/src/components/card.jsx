                Adanech Abebe is the current mayor of Addis Ababa, making
                history as the first woman to hold the position. She was
                appointed in 2020 and has since focused on urban development and
                improving public services. Before becoming mayor, she served as
                Ethiopiaâ€™s Minister of Revenue. Adanech is known for her
                leadership in reforming tax systems and combating corruption. As
                mayor, she has worked on infrastructure projects and housing
                programs for low-income residents. Her role highlights the
                increasing presence of women in Ethiopian politics and
                leadership.
