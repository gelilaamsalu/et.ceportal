              and has since focused on urban development and improving public
              services. Before becoming mayor, she served as Ethiopiaâ€™s Minister
              of Revenue. Adanech is known for her leadership in reforming tax
              systems and combating corruption. As mayor, she has worked on

              residents. Her role highlights the increasing presence of women in
              Ethiopian politics and leadership.

            Addis Ababa is the capital city of Ethiopia and one of the highest
            capitals in the world, sitting at about 2,355 meters above sea
            level. It was founded in 1886 by Emperor Menelik II and means "new
            flower" in Amharic. The city serves as the political, cultural, and
            economic center of the country. It is home to the African Union
            headquarters and numerous international organizations. Addis Ababa
            is known for its diverse population, vibrant markets, and historic
            landmarks like the National Museum and Holy Trinity Cathedral.
            Despite rapid development, the city still preserves elements of its
            rich cultural heritage.
